Mobile Fu
=========

Want to automatically detect mobile devices that access your Rails application?
Mobile Fu allows you to do just that.  People can access your site from a Palm,
Blackberry, iPhone, iPad, Nokia, etc. and it will automatically adjust the format
of the request from :html to :mobile or :tablet.

Installation
------------

Simply add `gem 'mobile-fu'` to your Gemfile and run bundle install.

Usage
-----

Add this this one line to the controller (you may need to restart your server afterwards).

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu
    end

Once this is in place, any request that comes from a mobile device will be be
set as :mobile format.  It is up to you to determine how you want to handle
these requests.  It is also up to you to create the .mobile.erb or .mobile.haml versions of
your views that are to be requested.

Mobile Fu automatically adds a new `:mobile` and `:tablet` to `text/html` mime type 
alias for Rails apps. If you already have a custom `:mobile` alias registered in 
  `config/initializers/mime_types.rb`, you can remove that.

I recommend that you setup a before_filter that will redirect to a specific page
depending on whether or not it is a mobile request.  How can you check this?

    is_mobile_device? # => Returns true or false depending on the device or
    
    is_tablet_device? # => Returns true if the device is a tablet

You can also determine which format is currently set in by calling the following:

    in_mobile_view? # => Returns true or false depending on current req. format or
    
    in_tablet_view? # => Returns true if the current req. format is for tablet view

Also, if you want the ability to allow a user to switch between 'mobile' and
'standard' format (:html), you can just adjust the mobile_view session variable
in a custom controller action.

    session[:mobile_view] # => Set to true if request format is :mobile and false
                               if set to :html
                               
    session[:tablet_view] # => Set to true if request format is :tablet and false
                               if set to :html

So, different devices need different styling.  Don't worry, we've got this
baked in to Mobile Fu.

If you are including a css or sass file via `stylesheet_link_tag`, all you have
to do is add _device to the name of one of your files to override your styling
for a certain device.  The stylesheet that is loaded is dependent on which device
is making the request.

  e.g., Accessing a page from a Blackberry.

    ...  stylesheet_link_tag 'mobile.css' ...

  This loads mobile.css, and mobile_blackberry.css if the file exists.

Supported stylesheet override device extensions at the moment are:

  * blackberry
  * iphone (iphone,ipod)
  * ipad
  * android
  * mobileexplorer
  * nokia
  * palm

The stylesheet awesomeness was derived from [Michael Bleigh's browserized styles](http://www.intridea.com/2007/12/9/announcing-browserized-styles)

Inspiration for Mobile Fu came from [Noel Rappin's rails_iui](http://blogs.pathf.com/agileajax/2008/05/rails-developme.html)

Hopefully this should help you create some awesome mobile applications.

Ignoring specific request formats
------------------------
If you want to ignore certain request format

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu :ignore_formats => [:json]
    end  
    
you can even permanently ignore tablet request formats (tablets will default to html)

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu :ignore_formats => [:tablet]
    end

If you want to check a format against the ignore list (returns `true` or `false`)

    is_ignored?(:json)

Ignoring specific controller actions
------------------------
If you want to have mobile-fu not run for specific actions within a controller

    class AwesomebbqsauceController < ActionController::Base
      has_no_mobile_fu_for :create, :update, :some_other_action 
    end
    
Testing Mobile Interface
------------------------

If you want to force the mobile interface for testing, you can either use a
mobile device emulator, or you can call `force_mobile_format` in a before filter or simply pass true.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu
      before_filter :force_mobile_format
    end
    
    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu true
    end

You can also force the tablet view by calling `force_tablet_format` instead

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu
      before_filter :force_tablet_format
    end

If you don't want mobile_fu to set the request format automatically, you can pass false.

    class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
      has_mobile_fu false
    end
